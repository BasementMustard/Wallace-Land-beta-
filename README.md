Wallace Land beta is the beta for a casual/strategy game i am programming. (Alpha already programmed)
If it is named 'beta', it is under development (do not download anything yet).
If it is named 'Wallace Land V1.1', it is the the first downloadable version of Wallace Land.

Further info will be told later.

Thank you!
